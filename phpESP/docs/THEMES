PHPESP SURVEY THEMES
====================

The ability to create themes for surveys is accomplished through the
use of css (cascading style sheets). A theme is made possible by
copying and then editing the template.css style sheet located in the
css directory. This "template" consists of the following class
definitions. Before we examine the classes it is worth noting that you
should not change the names of the actual classes nor add additional
classes without editing the way that surveys are rendered. However you
are free to add, delete, modify any of the classes' attributes.

THE CLASSES:
1/ headerGraphic: allows for the inclusion of a graphic at the top of
   your survey and works in conjunction with the 2/image class. If you
   do not wish to include such a graphic you may simply omit these two
   classes from your css file.
3/ surveyTitle: allows for the formatting of the survey's title.
4/ surveySubtitle: allows for the formatting of the survey's subtitle.
5/ addInfo: allows for the formatting of the "additional Information"
   that can be included just after the survey's subtitle.
6/ message: allows for the formatting of the messages that appear at
   the top of the survey when a user tries to submit a survey without
   completing all required questions.
7/ reqQuestion: allows for the formatting of the required Question
   string that appears near the top of the survey when the survey
   contains required questions.
8/ mainTable: allows for the formatting of the main table. This is the
   table that contains all other survey elements.
9/ preQuestionBorder: allows for the formatting of the row that appears
   just before each survey question.

each question is now contained within a nested table structure which
consists of an outer table and an inner table. This structure allows
the theme creator to add a border around each question if so desired.
The class for this outer table is 10/ qnOuterTable.

The inner table class 11/ qnInnerTable: is required if such borders are
to be created. To create a border the qnOuterTable class should have a
background-color attribute set. This color will form the border. To
complete the border effect the qnInnerTable class should also have a
background-color attribute set.

12/ qnInnerTd: allows for the formatting of the question number.
13/ qnInner: allows for the formatting of the column that contains the
    question text.
14/ qnType: allows for the formatting of the column that contains the
    question type (radio buttons, check boxes, etc..).
15/ thankHead: allows for the formatting of the thank you heading that
    appears after a user has successfully submitted a survey.
16/ thankBody: allows for the formatting of the thank you text that
    appears just under the thank you heading.
17/ returnLink: allows for the formatting of the "return" link that
    appears on the thank you page.

Finally there exists one further definition which is 18/ body: This is
not a class but a redefinition of the body HTML tag. This can be used
to format the survey's background color, background image, left, right,
top margins etc.

To ensure that survey themes work correctly you must ensure:
1/ that a css directory exists, preferably within your phpESP
   directory, and that: a/its path is indicated in the phpESP.ini file.
   and b/ it is readable by the web server.
2/ that all the survey css files are contained within this directory
   and created prior to creating the survey that will require it.
3/ that any header graphics used are contained in a directory
   recognized by the web server. It would be preferable to keep these
   images in a subdirectory within phpESP's image directory.
4/ that you do not use attributes that are known to cause major
   problems in some browsers. for example: the cell-spacing, rowspan
   attributes do not work in many browsers, and the width attribute is
   not handled properly by Netscape 4.78 Linux, other css properties
   that NN4.xx browsers cannot render include background-attachment,
   background-position, border-top, border-left, border-bottom,
   bottom-right, display (except display:none), font-variant,
   letter-spacing, list-style-image, list-style-position,
   vertical-align, word-spacing, white-space:nowrap, first-line and
   first-letter pseudo-elements.

Finally, if you do not wish to apply a theme to a survey it is
recommended that you use the default.css style.

The "template" css file that has been provided has been tested with the
following browsers:
Linux:
  a/ Opera 6.0 - no problems.
  b/ Konqueror 2.2-11 - no problems.
  c/ Mozilla 0.9.2.1 - no problems.
  d/ Netscape Navigator 4.78 - does not like the width attribute and I
     was unable to get the headerGraphic and image classes to work.
Windows:
  a/ Internet Explorer 6.0 - no problems.
  b/ Netscape 4.78 - as mentioned above.
  c/ Netscape 6 - no problems.
