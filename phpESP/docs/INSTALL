****** NOTICE ******
You should backup your production phpESP database before upgrading to this release.
We are now using ADODB and have made significant changes to the database API which
may cause unknown data corruption.

Also if you are upgrading mySQL to version 4.1 or above, on an existing phpESP 
installation you need to read the UPDATING document in this directory, especially
the UPDATING DATABASE section.

INSTALLING PHPESP
=================

This document contains instructions for installing phpESP on your
system.


OBTAINING PHPESP
----------------

phpESP can be obtained from the phpESP web site, at

   http://phpesp.sourceforge.net/

The most current release version and the most current development
version are listed on the main page.  Older releases are available from
the "Files" section of the Source Forge project page.  All distribution
files can be unpacked using tar+gunzip (see INSTALLING PHPESP, below). 

Bleeding-edge development versions of phpESP are available via CVS; see
the file docs/HACKING for information on accessing the phpESP CVS
repository.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

The following prerequisites are REQUIRED for phpESP to function
properly.

  1. A web server that supports PHP.

     phpESP is developed under the Apache web server, which we
     recommend.  Apache is available from

        http://httpd.apache.org/

     phpESP may work under Microsoft IIS, but is known to have certain
     problems.

  2. PHP 4.2.1 or above.

     PHP is the interpreted language in which phpESP is written.  You
     can obtain PHP at

        http://www.php.net/

     Follow the instructions in the PHP package to build PHP for your
     system.  If you use Apache, be sure to build PHP as a library with
     the

         --with-apache
     or
         --with-apxs

     options to ./configure.

     The following PHP options are REQUIRED by phpESP (listed with
     their own prerequisites and configure options).  In many cases,
     the required libraries and tools can be obtained as packages from
     your operating system vendor.

       a. MySQL support.  (--with-mysql)

          phpESP uses a MySQL database to store survey information,
          responses to surveys, and user information.  Information on
          obtaining MySQL is available at

            http://www.mysql.com/
        
          (Future versions may allow the use of any database supported
          by the PEAR database abstraction class.)

     The following PHP options are RECOMMENDED to enable advanced
     features in phpESP:

       a. Gettext support.  (--with-gettext)

          Gettext is the GNU Translation Project's localization
          library.  phpESP uses gettext to provide local translations
          of text displayed by the designer interface.  Information on
          obtaining the gettext package is available at

             http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html

          (See also note below on configuring translations.)

  3. Additional PEAR Modules

     PEAR is short for "PHP Extension and Application Repository".  The
     goal of PEAR is to provide a means of distributing reusable code.

     For more information, see http://pear.php.net/

     At this time, phpESP does not use any PEAR modules.  Future
     versions of phpESP will take advantage of PEAR.


INSTALLING PHPESP
-----------------

phpESP is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible
directory.  The precise location of this directory will differ from
system to system.  If you have no idea where you should be installing
phpESP, install it directly under the root of your web server's
document tree.

Since phpESP is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary;
simply expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename
the root directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear
in the URL.  For example, with the Apache web server's default document
root of '/usr/local/apache/htdocs', you would type:

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs
   tar zxvf /path/to/phpESP-1.6.tar.gz
   mv phpESP-1.6 phpESP

and would then find phpESP at the URL

   http://your-server/phpESP/

The default user name is "root" and has a password of "esp".  You
should login and change this password immediately after you configure
phpESP.  This user name and password are for logging into phpESP, do
not confuse them with the database user name and password below.


CONFIGURING PHPESP
------------------

1. Configuring the web server

   phpESP requires the following web server settings.  Examples shown
   are for Apache; other web servers' configurations will differ.

   a. PHP interpretation for files matching "*.php"

         AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

   Note: The above instructions may not work if you have specified PHP
         as an output filter with SetOutputFilter directive  in Apache
         2.x versions.  In particular, RedHat 8.0 Apache 2.x RPMS have
         the output filter set, and MUST NOT have the above AddType
         directive added.

   b. "index.php" as an index file (brought up when a user requests a
      URL for a directory)

         DirectoryIndex index.php

2. Creating databases

   If you are upgrading an existing version of phpESP please read
   "docs/UPDATING" for instructions on updating your database.

   a. Database and User

      First, look at the "scripts/db/mysql_create.sql" file.  This
      script, when run as the root user in mysql, will create a
      database and user for phpESP.  Be sure to change the default
      password, "phpesp", to something else before executing the
      script!  (Remember to use this password when you configure phpESP
      in the next step.)

      Alternatively, you may create the database and user for phpESP on
      your own.  This can easily be done with a tool like phpMyAdmin.

   b. Tables and Data
   
      Once a database and user have been created for phpESP, go to
      the configured url, eg. http://your-server/phpESP/, the creation
      of tables and initial data is all web based.


3. Configuring phpESP

   To configure phpESP, change to the admin/ directory of the installed
   distribution, and create "phpESP.ini.php".  Most users will only have
   to change a few settings in this file.  The most common changes are
   to the 'base_url', and to the database username and password
   ('db_user' and 'db_pass'). The defaults for this file can be found
   "phpESP.ini.php.default", so copy only the things you need to change.
   Also a file "phpESP.ini.php.fixed" exists, containing values you should
   never touch.
   The sequence is this:

   require (phpESP.ini.php.default);
	 ==> defaults, gets overwritten with every new release
   require (phpESP.ini.php);
	 ==> your own values, never gets overwritten
   require (phpESP.ini.php.fixed);
	 ==> fixed parts, you can change these, but they get overwritten
	     with every new release

   Note for international users:  phpESP uses GNU gettext to provide
   local translations of text displayed by applications; the
   translations are found in the locale/ directory.  If a translation
   is not yet available for your locale (and you wish to create one),
   or if you are having trouble using a provided translation, please
   see the "docs/TRANSLATIONS" file for instructions.

4. Securing phpESP

   a. Passwords

      phpESP's configuration file contains passwords which local users
      could use to access your database.  It is recommended to ensure
      that at least the phpESP configuration files (admin/phpESP.ini.php*)
      are not readable to system users.

      An additional approach is to make phpESP's configuration file
      owned by the user 'root' and by a group which only the web server
      user belongs to, and then making it readable only to owner and
      group.  For example, if your web server runs as www.www, do as
      follows:

         chown root.www admin/phpESP.ini.php.fixed
         chmod 0440 admin/phpESP.ini.php.fixed
         chown root.www admin/phpESP.ini.php.default
         chmod 0440 admin/phpESP.ini.php.default
         chown root.www admin/phpESP.ini.php
         chmod 0440 admin/phpESP.ini.php

   b. Sessions

      Session data -- including hashed versions of your users'
      passwords, in some applications -- may not be stored as securely
      as necessary.

      If you are using file-based PHP sessions (which are the default),
      be sure that session files are not being written into /tmp with
      permissions that allow other users to read them.  Ideally, change
      the 'session.save_path' setting in php.ini to a directory only
      readable and writeable by your web server.

      Additionally, if phpESP is deployed at a hosting service that
      uses a server farm you may have problems with sessions.  If all
      servers do not share a common 'session.save_path', sessions will
      break.  The solution to this problem is to use the php function
      session_save_path(), to change the path to a shared location. 
      Please make use of one of the support channels (below) if you
      encounter this problem.


5. Testing phpESP

   Once you have configured your web server, PHP, and phpESP, bring up
   the included test page in your Web browser to ensure that all
   necessary prerequisites have been met.  If you installed phpESP as
   described above, the URL to the test page would be

      http://your-server/phpESP/admin/test.php

   Check that your PHP and PEAR versions are acceptably recent, and
   that all required module capabilities are present.  Then note the
   "Session counter: 1" line under "PHP Sessions", and reload the page.
   The session counter should increment.
