PHPESP CHANGE LOG
=================

2.1.0 => 2.1.1
=========================
- Fixed some old issues with save/resume surveys
- Fresh installations didn't have initial data due to an xml schema mismatch, easy to fix but inconvenient.
- Changing a user or designer caused his password to become empty, not very wise ....

2.0.2 => 2.1.0
=========================
- Dashboard implementation (by Bishop Bettini)
- start/stop date for a survey (by Bishop Bettini)
- A conditional question resulted in a "non-required" for the question it depends on, this limit has been removed.
- You can now do authenticated ldap binds when searching for the uid, some LDAP servers need this (is more secure than anonymous binds anyway)
- A default config file has been added (admin/phpESP.ini.php.default), your own changes should go into admin/phpESP.ini.php. The advantage is that new options can be added to the default file and you don't need to change anything to your own config file. Also a fixed part has been added (admin/phpESP.ini.php.fixed) containing values that should not be changed. The sequence is:
require (phpESP.ini.php.default); ==> defaults, gets overwritten with every new release
require (phpESP.ini.php); ==> your own values, never gets overwritten
require (phpESP.ini.php.fixed); ==> fixed parts, you can change these, but they get overwritten with every new release
- Web based updates and web based installs are now possible, no more manually entering sql statements in the db
- Switching/changing database table prefixes is now possible
- An answer to a question of type textbox, essay or numerical can now be required to be unique

2.0.1 => 2.0.2
=========================
- Multiple small fixes (a php notice people were seeing, a small fix for managing admins and a fix for deleting a response for an active survey)

2.0.0 => 2.0.1
=========================
- Already on 2.0.1
- Changed language detection so you can select the language also in the admin interface
- some session cleanups
Changes from 1.8.2.e till 2.0.1 made by Franky(liedekef)

1.8.2.f => 2.0.0
=========================
- bumped the version to 2.0.0 (long overdue)
- Added the posibility to define conditions on a question. See the help page in the admin interface for more info. In short:
A question is only shown when a condition is met.
All conditions are "OR" conditions, so if one conditions is fullfilled, the question is shown.
A question that has a condition must be an optional question. So, if you define a condition on a question, the "Required" parameter is set to "No".
A question that has a condition must be on the next page than the question/value that is used to compare it with. Use the "Order tab" to insert a section break where wanted (this is NOT done automatically).

- Discovered the page admin/manage.php?where=purge, to purge a survey
- Added the possibility to purge a response from a survey (only superuser can do this): admin/manage.php?where=response_purge
- You can now configure the mail address used by phpesp when sending mails

20071107
=========================
- Correct LDAP auth, authenticated users are no longer recreated in the DB
- You can choose between LDAP authentication for respondents, designers or both
- Fixed some session checks when already logged in
- Fixed some typo's (why did nobody see these???)

20070615
=========================
Added option to disable automatic numbering of questions when showing the survey
Reworked a bit the "!other" anwser for radio/checkbox answers
The answer to numerical questions are now also checked (to see the answer is indeed numerical)

20070412
=========================
fixes for losing the session info when changing respondents or designers

uptill 20061201
- multiple fixes, see: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1598273&group_id=8956&atid=308956

I also added the possibility to choose the language in handler.php, either by GET option or by setting a $lang parameter. To do this, I added below the line

> require_once(ESP_BASE . '/admin/phpESP.ini.php');
the next lines:
< if (isset($_REQUEST['lang'])) {
< esp_setlocale_ex($_REQUEST['lang']);
< }
< if (isset($lang)) {
< esp_setlocale_ex($lang);
< }

So now handler.php?lang=nl_NL works, as well as setting $lang="nl_NL" and including handler.php as always.

20061202 (I think)
=========================
- added cookie checks to disable double postings (variable limit_double_postings in admin/phpESP.ini.php). It is disabled by default but I recommend you use it.
- You need to use public/phpESP.first.php in every php survey page now (at the beginning, because cookies and sessions are used)

20061205
=========================
- added a captcha as well, so no scripted answers are possible (variable use_captcha in admin/phpESP.ini.php). It is disabled by default but I recommend you use it.

1.8.2.f => 1.8.2e
=========================
- implemented captcha abuse prevention mechanism, and updated captcha.README. I'll probably release the captcha as a seperate program as well
- included patch 1609284

1.8.2 => 1.8.2f
=========================
- cookies to prevent double posting are no longer set if the survey is in test
- updated the help pages a bit
- added the ability to change the format of the date field, according to http://be.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php (I hope this'll work for everybody)
